# Factorial Formula

Given a number n, write a formula that returns n! (n factorial).

Incase you don't know what a factorial is, n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... 2 * 1.

For example: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 so we'd return 120.

Assume that n is a non-negative integer.

# Approach

Imported factorial package from the math library

Built a factorial function that takes an integer n

The factorial function covers edge cases

Built user input requirement that outputs the input integer along with its factorial
